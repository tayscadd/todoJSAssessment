# Vanilla Todo App Assessment

In 1 hour, please complete as many of the App Requirents as possible.

This template uses parcel.js to bundle the JS and CSS for you. I have provided the HTML and CSS. Currently it is static HTML in the index.html file. You can start coding right away in the index.js file in the src directory.

### Notes

- Use of a tutorial is not allowed. If you copy a full tutorial wholesale, it will be seen as plagerism.
- Googling JS functions, and features is ok. You are not expected to have every thing about JS memorized. Example: You can't remember what parameters the callback function of Array.reduce() receives, Google the MDN
- Editing the HTML/CSS is allowed if needed/wanted
- Examples of the `<li>` css is provided in the HTML with CSS classes for examples

# App Requirements

- App must be written in vanilla js. No libraries or frameworks. I.E. No React, Jquery, VueJS, ect.
- App must use the provided inital todos. (todos var in index.js) When initially loaded, it should show the provided todos with their correct state (completed or not).
- User should be able to add todos via the Enter new task input field
  - When user adds a todo, it should add to the todos array, creating a new id that is one count higher than the last one
  - User should be able to add todo via plus button

  - When user deletes todo from app, the todo is removed from the todos array
  - BONUS: Deleted todos aren't removed and are instead marked as deleted and not shown to the user
- User should be able to clear (delete) all todos that are done when they click the clear done button
  - The todos array should be updated accordingly
